          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>With respect and compassion for all animal life, MEOW promotes lifelong relationships between people and companion animals, providing shelter and care for each precious life until adopted into a forever home.<a href="https://meowcatrescue.org/about-us/" class="body-link"> Our story </a> MEOW envisions a day when society will be free from the dangers and nuisances of irresponsible pet ownership, when every pet born will be assured loving care all of its natural life and will never suffer due to abuse, neglect or ignorance.</p>
          <p>MEOW’s goal is to help create a “no-kill nation,” where people are responsible for their pets, where there are no helpless creatures abandoned in boxes or left to fend for themselves in parking lots, where there is no longer a need for any healthy companion animal to be euthanized. There are many worthy organizations and individuals </p>
